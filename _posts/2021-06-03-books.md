We were talking about O’Reilly learning and books this morning.
For those who don't know, I'm giving a Java course on O'Reilly every 2 months.

I thought it will be useful to create my list of books I think everyone should read.
I will keep it up to date so bookmark this page.

You can also find it on [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/playlists/386b4ce0-b3d4-49be-a3dc-02c0e4b94412) for the books available there (most of them).

In random order.

## Technical

* Refactoring
* Working Effectively with Legacy Code 
* Head First Design Patterns
* Effective Java
* Java Concurrency in Practice
* JUnit in Action
* Core Java
* Test-Driven Development
* Modern JavaScript for the impatient

## Methodology

* Continuous delivery
* The Goal
* Accelerate
* The Phoenix project
* Code Complete
* Rapid Development
* Clean Code (but don’t believe everything he says)
* Mythical Man-Month

The list is quite incomplete. 
I will add tons of books that worth your attention, but that's a good start. 
If you think watching videos and reading blog posts is enough, sorry you are wrong.

You will learn more with any of these books than by reading months of blog posts.
