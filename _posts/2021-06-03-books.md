We were talking about O’Reilly learning and books this morning.
For those who don't know, I'm giving a Java course on O'Reilly every 2 months.

I thought it will be useful to create my list of books I think everyone should read.
I will keep it up to date so bookmark this page.

You can also find it on [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/playlists/386b4ce0-b3d4-49be-a3dc-02c0e4b94412) for the books available there (most of them).

In random order.

The list is quite incomplete. 
I will add tons of books that worth your attention, but that's a good start. 
If you think watching videos and reading blog posts is enough, sorry you are wrong.

You will learn more with any of these books than by reading months of blog posts.
