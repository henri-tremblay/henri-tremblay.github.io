I tend to do a bit more Powerpoint that I would like to.

Today, I had to translate one. So to get correct spelling checks, I wanted to modify the Proofing language.

That's how to do it:

1. Open the Outline view
2. Select all the text in the view
3. Go to the Review tab
4. Select Language -> Set Proofing Language
5. Now select any language you like. It will be applied to the entire document
   
Yes, I promesse, the next entry will be more technical.
