A decade later, [My journey fixing]({% post_url 2017-06-02-mac-ui %}) the Mac UI is not over yet.

The pending concerns:
* `Cmd+Tab` should bring to front the requested window. Always. It doesn't matter if the window is minimized, in background or whatever. Just bring it in front
* `Cmd+Tab` should bring the last used window of an application to the front. Not my 6 Chrome windows. Only the latest one
* `Cmd+Ã¹` should behave as ``Cmd+` ``  when using a ca-fr keyboard. I can probably use the remap trick for that. I tried BTT, it doesn't work
* `Cmd+X` should cut everywhere. `Cmd+C` and then `Cmd+Alt+V` is just not the way my brain works. I think about copy or cut when seeing the file. Not when pasting it. Am I the only one?
* I use 2 keyboard layouts (US-en and CA-fr). Because Macs can't have a Canadian French keyboard. Only Canadian multilanguage with unreachable curly-braces. MacOS should remember which application is using which keyboard. However, I don't need it for each Chrome tab

A couple of months ago, the `Cmd+Tab` issue finally got solved using a third-party open-source software named [AltTab](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos).
It finally allows to switch between specific windows and not full application.
It also remembers nicely that last window that had the focus.

One problem down.
