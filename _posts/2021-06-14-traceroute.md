I'm not the best at diagnosing network issue.

Yes, in 99% of the cases, you think the problem is the network and it's not.
But in rare cases it actually is.

A friend of mine has written an awesome [guide to diagnose network issues using traceroute](https://obkio.com/documents/complete-guide-to-traceroutes/).
He also happens to have founded a startup named [Okio](https://obkio.com/) doing network monitoring.

Read it, I have learned tons of things from it.

Full disclosure: In case of doubt, I have no interest in this company. 
I do think that have a great product and that the guide is a fabulous piece of work.
